# Computer Vision Projects
The height.ipynb file is for calculating the real world height of targeted object in image using numpy module.
In this problem, the reference height taken was 1.85.
The input coordinates are given using Junit.

The hybrid.ipynb file is to combine a low frequency image and high frequency image.
Gaussian filter was used for smoothing purpose.
alpha,beta are hyper parameters.
